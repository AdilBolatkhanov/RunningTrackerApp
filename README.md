# RunningTrackerApp
An app that tracks your running on Google Map that works as a foreground service. User can
track their progress by viewing all runs and overall statistics: calories burned, distance, time, speed

## Applied concepts
* Kotlin
* MVVM architecture
* Dagger-Hilt as dependency injection
* Google Map API to show map, current location, and the path that the user passed.
* A single-activity architecture, using the Navigation Component to manage fragment operations
* Room to store all runs
* Kotlin Coroutines for background operations
